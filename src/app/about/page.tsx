            <p className="text-orange-700 mb-6">
              Building Harmonies began as a small gathering of friends who loved music and wanted to 
              share that passion with their neighbors. What started as informal jam sessions in living 
              rooms has grown into a beloved community tradition that brings together hundreds of 
              people for evenings filled with beautiful music and warm fellowship.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-orange-700 mb-8">
              Today, we continue that tradition by organizing events that feature both established 
              local artists and emerging talents, ensuring that our community's musical landscape 
              remains vibrant and diverse. Each event is carefully curated to provide a balanced, 
              engaging experience that appeals to music lovers of all ages and backgrounds.
            </p>
